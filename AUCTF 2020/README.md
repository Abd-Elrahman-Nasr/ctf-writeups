AUCTF 2020 has ended, and me and my team [**P1rates**](https://ctftime.org/team/113157) really enjoyed it as it was full of good problems, I participated as **T1m3-m4ch1n3** and here's my writeup about some of the problems that i solved.
*(if you're interested in the rest you can read the writeup of my teammate **y4mm1** [here](https://ah-sayed.github.io/posts/auctf-2020))*
